# MkDocs

I use MkDocs with [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).

Development environment is managed by [pyenv-virtualenv](pyenv.md) and is
activated if we are in the project directory.

To start development server run `mkdocs serve`.

When happy with the result, just push to master and CI will update live website.
